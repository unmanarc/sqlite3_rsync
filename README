sqlite3_rsync is a client-server application that synchronizes SQLite3 
databases using tables ROWID.

[+] Operational mode:

 - Server: It Waits for TCP Server connections. it may contain a partially
           filled database or no database at all.
 - Client: It connect to the Server, and if a database is updated on client
           side, the client push changes on server. 

[+] How to use it:

1st Recommendation: If the source database contains a lot of registries
                    copy the database file from the source to your storage
                    server. That will avoid our application to create and 
                    transfer the whole database to the server.


 [-] Then, start the synchronization server with the target backup database:

                 ./sqlite3_rsync -d ~/msgstore-w.db -s

 [-] Now, from the side where the origin database comes, start the client...

        ./sqlite3_rsync -v -c 192.168.0.100 -t messages -d msgstore.db 
 
     where 192.168.0.100 is the server ip address...

** Please don't hesitate to read the help (./sqlite3_rsync -h), if you need **
                     ** further details and options **

[+] Purporses:

Data replication. Which includes:

- Near Real Time backup of databases.
- Database synchronization

[+] Security recommendations:

This application uses a very simple and with almost no security considerations 
protocol, that includes no authentication mechanism, and no ciphering at all.

Use a tool like stunnel or a VPN to cipher and authenticate the communication 
of this application. Otherwise, your SQL queries could be exposed.
